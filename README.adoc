== Introduction

JavaCake is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing events preceding a wedding. More importantly, JavaCake is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JavaCake can get your wedding planning tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
