== Introduction

=== Purpose

This document specifies architecture and software design decisions for the educational app, JavaCake. The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of JavaCake. 

=== Design Goals

*Target user profile*:

* Has a need to gain a basic grasp of Java
* Prefers desktop apps over mobile
* Can type quickly
* Prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using Command Line Interface (CLI) apps
* Is goal-driven (likes setting goals for themselves)

Value proposition:
Managing the learning of Java and managing the learning progress through a desktop app which is CLI-based.
Developing JavaCake poses a unique software development situation. The developers work closely to ensure both technical and non-technical requirements are met in the 34development process. The design of JavaCake takes into consideration various factors such as user-friendliness and relevance.


== Setting up

1. Install JDK 11.
2. Fork this GitHub repository to your GitHub account: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-2/main.
3. Clone your fork to your local computer.
4. Configure your IDE of choice to set up structure for new projects in JDK 11.
5. We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
6. Import the project to your IDE as a Gradle project.

== Design

=== Architecture

The Architecture diagram given below (Figure 1) explains the high-level design of the app. Below it is a quick overview of each component.

.Architecture Diagram
image::dg_figure1.png[width="500"]

Main has two classes; Main and Duke.

[none]
* At app launch: Initialises the other class components in the proper sequence.
+
Main: Links up the respective resource files before launching the GUI.
+
Duke: Responsible for returning the back-end response for each user input.
* At app exit: Shuts down the app.

The rest of the program consists of four modules.

[none]
* Ui: Handles user interaction and user interface.
* Logic: Executes the respective command after user input is parsed.
* Model: Holds the current content and quiz questions in memory during the operation of the program.
* Storage: Reads data from and writes data to hard disk.

The sections below provide more information on each module.


=== Logic

Within the logic module, the major classes include ProgressStack, ListCommand, GotoCommand and BackCommand.

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::dg_figure2.png[width="500"]

=== Model

The Model stores a QuestionList object which itself consists of one or more Question objects. Model can then use this QuestionList object to set up a QuizSession or ReviewSession object which interfaces with UI to execute a quiz.

Model also references Storage in order to load and generate the QuestionList object from Storage when a QuestionList object is created.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::dg_figure3.png[width="500"]

=== Storage

The Storage module handles fetching data from and writing data to the hard disk. This module consists of the following classes: Profile, TaskStorage, TaskList and StorageManager. 

There are also enumeration classes used to keep track of the different types of tasks(TaskType) and different state of the task(TaskState).

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::dg_figure4.png[width="500"]

The `Storage` component,

[none]
* can save `Profile` objects in txt format and read it back.
* can save the `TaskStorage` data in txt format and read it back.

=== UI

The `UI` module handles the user interface and user interaction with the program. It consists of a MainWindow, which is made up of the following parts: DialogBox, TopBar and AvatarScreen. The API of the `UI` module is implemented by MainWindow.java in GUI mode. The module also contains a Ui class which defines the implementation of the API in CLI mode.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::dg_figure5.png[width="500"]

The UI component,

[none]
* In CLI Mode, executes user commands through the `Main` component which executes the respective commands in `Logic`.
* In GUI Mode, executes user commands through the `Main component which executes the respective commands in `Logic`. The output is then shown in the DialogBox class.
* Listens for changes to `Main` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.
* MainWindow implements Model for displaying output from QuizSession class.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

*Technologies Used*:

* Our source code is written in Java. However, we also leverage on JavaFX, fxml and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design our Graphical User Interface (GUI). The program also uses external libraries Natty Date Parser and Apache Commons IO.

* The Natty Date Parser library is used to parse relative dates and times in the Deadline feature (see part 4.X for details on its implementation), while the Apache Commons IO library is used to handle file cleanup in the Storage module.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

[appendix]
== User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * \*`, Medium (nice to have) - `* \*`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is the `Cake` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

[discrete]
=== Use case: Find topics

*MSS*

1. User requests to list topics
2. Cake shows topics (in format 1. X\n 2. Y\n...)
3. User types the topic number e.g. `1`
4. Cake shows sub-topics within that topic (in format 1. X\n 2. Y\n...)
5. User types the sub-topic number e.g. `1`
6. Cake shows the content in the sub-topic
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 3a. If user types in `1.1`, user can immediately jump to sub-topic content
+
[none]
** 3a1. If no sub-topic present, Cake shows error message
+
Use case resumes at step 5.

[discrete]
=== Use case: Check progress

*MSS*

1. _User finishes topic/quiz_
2. Cake shows progress bar ( [# # # # _ _ _ _] )
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 2a. User types in command to check progress again
+
Use case ends.

[discrete]
=== Use case: Do quiz from sub-topic

*MSS*

1. _User requests for sub-topic list_
2. User selects quiz by typing `quiz` or types in the index of the quiz in the list e.g. `7`
3. Cake launches quiz
4. User answers the questions
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 4a. User types invalid input
+
[none]
** 4a1. Cake shows error message
+

+
[none]
** 4b1. Cake shows "Wrong Answer" and proceeds to next question.
+
Use case ends

[discrete]
=== Use case: Set deadline for topics/sub-topics to read

*MSS*

1. User requests to list topics
2. Cake shows topics
3. User sets deadline for a topic `deadline 1 /by <DATE/>`
4. Cake shows confirmation message (adds to appended topic header list)
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 4a. If user decides to list topics again, deadline is appended to topic header
+
Use case ends.
* 4b. If user launches program again, the deadlines for each topic are shown in most recent deadline order.
+
** 4b1. If user finishes the quiz for that topic, the deadline will be removed from Cake

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
