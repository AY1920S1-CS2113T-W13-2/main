== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

[appendix]
== User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * \*`, Medium (nice to have) - `* \*`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is the `Cake` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

[discrete]
=== Use case: Find topics

*MSS*

1. User requests to list topics
2. Cake shows topics (in format 1. X\n 2. Y\n...)
3. User types the topic number e.g. `1`
4. Cake shows sub-topics within that topic (in format 1. X\n 2. Y\n...)
5. User types the sub-topic number e.g. `1`
6. Cake shows the content in the sub-topic
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 3a. If user types in `1.1`, user can immediately jump to sub-topic content
+
[none]
** 3a1. If no sub-topic present, Cake shows error message
+
Use case resumes at step 5.

[discrete]
=== Use case: Check progress

*MSS*

1. _User finishes topic/quiz_
2. Cake shows progress bar ( [# # # # _ _ _ _] )
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 2a. User types in command to check progress again
+
Use case ends.

[discrete]
=== Use case: Do quiz from sub-topic

*MSS*

1. _User requests for sub-topic list_
2. User selects quiz by typing `quiz` or types in the index of the quiz in the list e.g. `7`
3. Cake launches quiz
4. User answers the questions
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

[none]
* 4a. User types invalid input
+
[none]
** 4a1. Cake shows error message
Use case resumes at step 2.

* 4b. User types wrong answer
+
[none]
** 4b1. Cake shows "Wrong Answer" and proceeds to next question.
+
Use case ends

[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
