Abstract Class

Are classes that cannot be used instantiated to make objects. Instead they contain a template for other classes.
They contain the keyword 'abstract' in its declaration.

Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )
But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.

To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the
abstract methods in it.
If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.
