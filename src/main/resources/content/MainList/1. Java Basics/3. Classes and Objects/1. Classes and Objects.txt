Classes in Java

A class is a template for objects.
It contains the behaviour of objects of the same kind.

Say for example we want to create a class of Person, and declare certain
attributes to it as described in the code below:

public class Person {
   String name;
   int age;
   String race;

   //constructor of the new class
   public Person() {
   }

   void working() {
   }

   void hungry() {
   }

   void sleeping() {
   }
}

Now if you want to create a new person in your program named Alice,
you can simply declare it as such:

Person Alice = new Person();

Note : Multiple objects can be created from a class.
